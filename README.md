# ML Ops Inspired Automated Web Application

***The general idea of the project is to encapsulate general Machine Learning Model Training, it's training simulation and finally 
to display the inference with general Exploratory Data Analysis libraries.***

The user will have the ability to ***explore data mapping, model selection, and getting the output all with a matter of simple clicks!***

This progressive web app integrates the Machine Learning life cycle along with the development of model inference, 
which can have the ability to handle *data re-collection, data selection, performing one-step EDA, Model selection as per use case, 
training, and getting results and one-click hyperparameter tuning* for better features selection. 
Moreover we have incorperated real-time tracking of analytical model training performance[Only for Deep Learning Models].

## A Pipeline of the model we have created:

**<h3>Firstly</h3>**
*Classes are easily imported without any hassles.*

They include:<pre>   
	- Load_Data<br>
	- PreProcessing<br>
	- Model_Fitting<br>
	- Evaluations<br>
	- Predictions<br>
	- Custom_Inference </pre>
<br><hr>
**<h3>Secondly</h3>**
The models include:

 <u>***Supervised Learning:***</u><br><pre>
	- Linear Regression<br>
	- Logistic Regression<br>
	- Naive Bayes<br>
	- Support Vector Machines<br>
	- Natural Language Processing</pre>
<br><br>
 <u>***Unsupervised Learning:***</u><br><pre>
	- KNN<br>
	- DBSCAN<br>
	- K-Means Cluster<br>
	- LDA<br>
	- NMF</pre>
<br><br>
 <u>***Tensorflow Neural Networks:***</u><br><pre>
	- ANN<br>
	- CNN<br>
	- Multi-Class Classification<br>
	- Sentiment Analysis<br>
	- Text Generation</pre>

***Streamlit*** is used to include all the models in our web application to productionalize it.
And we have deployed the application on the web using Heroku, to access the application

<h3>Thirdly</h3>
<u>Further, we have implemented the real-time tracking with the help of Google Firebase.</u>
The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that lets you store and sync data between your users in realtime.
Hence the data in fed from firebase in-real-time and it is visualized on the graphs.
<hr>
<h3>Finally</h3>
We come to the end of the project, where we have created a ***'One Click EDA'***
***The EDA consists of :***<pre>
	univariate graphical,<br> 
	multivariate graphical,<br> 
	univariate non-graphical,<br>
	and multivariate non-graphical</pre>

	but we have consolidated all the above into a single functionality.

*With this, we hope you liked the project, if you did please make sure to leave a star, that will surely boost our morale! Thanks!*

NOTE : This project is made with the intention that an ordinary person can make sense out of, in other words, one who does not have any prior 
Machine Learning knowledge.
